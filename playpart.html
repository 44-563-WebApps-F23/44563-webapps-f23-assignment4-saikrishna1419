        <p class="speech">Upon my word, I don't believe they are stirring yet!</p>
        
        <h5 class="name_berta">BERTA</h5>
        <p class="direction">[Also softly.] </p>
        <p class = "speech">I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
        in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
        young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.</p>

        <h5 class="name_miss">MISS TESMAN</h5>
        <p class="speech">Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
        good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.</p>

        <h5 class ="name_berta">BERTA</h5>
        <p class="direction">[Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]</p>
        <p class="speech">I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
        Miss.</p>
        <p class="direction">[She places it on the piano.]</p>

        <h5 class="name_miss">MISS TESMAN</h5>
        <p class="speech">So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
        wrench to me to part with you.</p>

        <h5 class="name_berta">BERTA</h5>
        <p class="direction">[the point of weeping.] </p>
        <p class="speech">And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
        Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)</p>

        <h5 class="name_miss">MISS TESMAN.</h5>
        <p class="speech">We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
        George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
        to look after him ever since he was a little boy.</p>
